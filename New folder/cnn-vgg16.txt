1.1    VGG16
VGG16 was publised in 2014 and is one of the simplest (among the other cnn architectures used in Imagenet competition). It's Key Characteristics are:

This network contains total 16 layers in which weights and bias parameters are learnt.
A total of 13 convolutional layers are stacked one after the other and 3 dense layers for classification.
The number of filters in the convolution layers follow an increasing pattern (similar to decoder architecture of autoencoder).
The informative features are obtained by max pooling layers applied at different steps in the architecture.
The dense layers comprises of 4096, 4096, and 1000 nodes each.
The cons of this architecture are that it is slow to train and produces the model with very large size.
